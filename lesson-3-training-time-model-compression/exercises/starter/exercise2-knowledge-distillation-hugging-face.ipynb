    "# Exercise 2: Distill knowledge from a pre-trained language model to a smaller student model\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we often train large, powerful models that achieve high accuracy but are computationally expensive for deployment. Knowledge distillation is a powerful technique to transfer the 'knowledge' from a large \"teacher\" model to a smaller \"student\" model. The student learns to mimic the teacher's behavior, often retaining a significant portion of the teacher's performance while being much more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Overview**: We will apply knowledge distillation to compress a pre-trained transformer model by training a smaller student model to reproduce the teacher's soft predictions on a classification task. This will result in a more efficient model suitable for resource-constrained environments.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Goal**: Implement knowledge distillation to create a smaller language model that maintains high accuracy while being more deployable for tasks like text classification.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Scenario**: Your SaaS company's support system uses a BERT model to identify duplicate customer tickets. While the system works perfectly, it's an overkill - the task is simple after all: determine if tickets like \"Can't login to my account\" and \"Unable to access my account\" are duplicates. And, yet, you are burning thousands in cloud costs for what should be a lightweight operation. So, you decide to simplify the model's architecture via knowledge distillation.\n",

    "> **Tools**: pytorch, transformers, numpy, matplotlib\n",

    "> - More hesitant on conceptual differences (upload vs files, export vs download)\n",

    "> Through distillation, the student developed its own \"personality\" while still matching the teacher's overall accuracy. It's like teaching someone chess and they develop their own playing style!\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you've learned how to:\n",
    "* Implement knowledge distillation loss functions combining soft and hard targets\n",
    "* Train student models to mimic teacher behavior through temperature-scaled predictions\n",
    "* Balance distillation and ground truth losses using alpha weighting\n",
    "* Create smaller models that preserve teacher's nuanced understanding\n",
    "* Evaluate compression trade-offs between model size, speed, and accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills allow you to create inherently efficient models through training-time compression, rather than post-hoc optimization. Knowledge distillation is particularly valuable when changing architectures (BERT to DistilBERT) or when preserving subtle task understanding is critical for production quality."
