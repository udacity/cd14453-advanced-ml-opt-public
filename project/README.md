# UdaciSense: Optimized Object Recognition

In this project, you will develop a comprehensive compression pipeline for a pre-trained computer vision model designed to recognize household objects. Working as a Machine Learning Engineer at SmartHome Tech, you'll optimize their flagship app "UdaciSense" to reduce model size, improve inference speed, and maintain accuracy for mobile deployment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up your development environment and understand the project structure.

### Installation

> **🧑‍🎓 For Udacity students**: If you are running in Udacity's hosted environment, you can skip to *step 3.* below.

1. Clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/cd14453-advanced-ml-opt.git

cd cd14453-advanced-ml-opt/project/starter_kit
```

2. The project requires the following major dependencies:

```
pytorch>=1.12.0
torchvision>=0.13.0
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
```

Which are all collected within the `requirements.txt` file.

You can install for your environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


3. Install the project as a local package (this makes internal modules accessible). From the `starter-kit` directory run the following command:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

## Project Instructions

Your task is to optimize a pre-trained computer vision model for mobile deployment while meeting these specific requirements:

- ✔️ Reduce model size by **30%**
- ✔️ Reduce inference time by **40%**
- ✔️ Maintain accuracy within **5%** of the baseline

**Within the `notebooks/` and `compression/` folders, you will find the TODOs for you to complete.**

> **IMPORTANT**: Always feel free to update any of the starter kit that's been provided to you if desired, even if outside of a *TODO*. This includes function definition, class definitions, variables, any other logic, and report template! 🤖

### Project Workflow

Your entry point for this project is the `notebooks/` folder.

> **💻 For non-Udacity students**: If you are not running in Udacity's hosted environment, set up with [JupyterLab locally](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) or through another host.

1. Establish baseline performance ([`01_baseline.ipynb`](starter_kit/notebooks/01_baseline.ipynb))

    - Familiarize with code base for model training and evaluation
    - Review baseline model performance
    - Analyze model architecture and use case for compression opportunities


2. Implement and evaluate compression techniques ([`02_compression.ipynb`](starter_kit/notebooks/02_compression.ipynb))

    - Implement at least two different compression methods
    - Experiment with hyperparameters and configurations for each technique
    - Document the experimentation results and ideas for combining methods in the multi-stage compression pipeline

3. Design a multi-stage compression pipeline ([`03_pipeline.ipynb`](starter_kit/notebooks/03_pipeline.ipynb))

    - Define an implementation plan for the multi-stage compression pipeline
    - Combine techniques into an optimal compression strategy
    - Select the best performing pipeline based on requirements 
    - Report results and insights on different pipeline configurations

    > **NOTE**: You should try to meet the CTO requirements at this stage!

4. Package for mobile deployment ([`04_deployment.ipynb`](starter_kit/notebooks/04_deployment.ipynb))

    - Convert the optimized model to mobile-ready format
    - Verify functionality for mobile deployment
    - Collect insights and ideas for future work in a final analysis

5. Complete your final report  ([`report.md`](starter_kit/report.md))

    - Define an executive summary for your business audience
    - Collect the most important technical insights and results
    - Conclude with next steps and recommendations

### Deliverables

- [ ] Completed notebooks with all code cells executed
- [ ] Implementation of at least two compression techniques
- [ ] A multi-stage compression pipeline
- [ ] A mobile-ready optimized model
- [ ] A comprehensive report documenting your process and results
