    "# Discover LLM graph optimizations with ONNX\n",
    "\n",
    "ONNX graph optimization enables deep learning models to run more efficiently by transforming and simplifying their computational graphs—without altering model accuracy or outputs. This is especially valuable when deploying in resource-constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Overview**: We'll apply graph optimization techniques to a pre-trained LLM using ONNX's built-in optimization recipes. We also demonstrate how to use Netron for visual model inspection and share considerations for hardware-aware optimizations.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Goal**: Optimize a large language model (LLM) for fast, CPU-only inference in constrained environments by applying ONNX graph transformations—without retraining or modifying the model's behavior.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Scenario:** You are part of a humanitarian organization developing an AI assistant for disaster \n",
    "response teams. The chatbot helps provide critical information during emergencies. In field conditions:\n",
    "> - No internet connectivity exists\n",
    "> - Power is limited (battery/generator only)\n",
    "> - Only CPU-based hardware is available\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ONNX graph optimization offers a practical solution: it reduces computational overhead and accelerates model inference—making it feasible to deploy advanced language models in the field with minimal infrastructure.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Tools**: ONNX, ONNX Runtime, Hugging Face Optimum, Transformers, Netron\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ONNX?** [ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)](https://onnxruntime.ai/) enables models to run across different frameworks and hardware. For disaster response, this means the same model can run on Windows laptops, Linux servers, or mobile devices—whatever's available in the field. No framework-specific dependencies required."
